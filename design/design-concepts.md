Since the due date for this project is Valentine’s Day, I chose a Vintage Valentine theme. 
I found images that are copyright-free and in the public domain. I hope the results will look both fun and interesting 
to the viewer. 

I love the layout of the CSS ZenGarden example “Under the Sea” and wanted to do something similar. I also like the idea of
images and text looking like they are arranged in a non-grid-like layout, but really are following a grid.

I envision the title positioned in the standard logo-area at the top left of the page, the background white, like the 
envelope for a valentine, and a border about an inch inside the body container so valentines can fall off the edges. 
Much of the written content will be incorporated with the valentine images.  

In the attached wireframe, I laid out sections and then outlined the image areas in green and the text areas in blue to make 
sure they were evenly distributed on the page.
I hope to invoke a sense of fun and playfulness to keep the reader on the site, read the text, and click on the links.
